I am an assistant professor at the Engineering Institute of [Universidad de O'Higgins](https://www.uoh.cl).
Before that, I was a postdoc in [Karl Bringmann's](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kbringma/) group at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html).
I did my PhD at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/), where I was advised by [Torsten Mütze](http://www.tmuetze.de) and took part of the [Combinatorial Optimization and Graph Algorithms](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/coga/) group. 
I also did a masters degree on applied math at [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/english) under the guidance of [José Soto](http://www.dim.uchile.cl/~jsoto/).

**Research Interests:**  I am interested in algorithmic design and, broadly speaking, in discrete mathematics.
Lately, I've been focused on the design of [*generation/enumeration algorithms*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumeration_algorithm); that is, algorithms which ouput all solutions to a computational problem, instead of only one. 
More specifically, I've been interested in generation algorithms that perform *local* operations (aka [*combinatorial Gray codes*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01280)) and their interplay with combinatorics, discrete geometry, symmetry, and algebra.
